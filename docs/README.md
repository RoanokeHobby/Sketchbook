**February 3, 2018**

And so a new year begins! Today's Roanoke Robotics and Makers Club meeting
featured a presentation by Steven F. LeBrun on "Creating Good Header Files" -
when the get the code and notes become available, they will be posted here
in this GitHub Repository.

As mentioned during the session, a goal for future meetings is to develop
and publish a working Arduino library for use with a motor controller board:
the Seeed-Studio [Motor Shield V2.0](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Motor_Shield_V2.0/).
More details and progress on this project will be posted on the 
[Library Files](Page2.md) page.  Stay tuned!
